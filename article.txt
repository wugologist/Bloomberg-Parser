for bankruptcy court permission to shut down its synthetic-sapphire operations, citing terms of a contract with Apple Inc.
that it called “oppressive” and “burdensome.” </p>
<p>GT Advanced, based in Merrimack, New Hampshire, filed for
bankruptcy this week, less than a year after announcing an
agreement to supply sapphire to <a topic_url="http://topics.bloomberg.com/apple-inc/" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US" density="full" title="Get Quote" ticker="AAPL:US" class="web_ticker">Apple. (AAPL)</a> The substance is used to
make screens on mobile devices more durable. The company told
the court today that it was going through cash too fast and must
halt operations in Mesa, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/arizona/" density="full">Arizona</a>, and Salem, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/massachusetts/" density="full">Massachusetts</a>, by
Dec. 31, at a cost of 890 jobs. </p>
<p>“The cash burn at GTAT’s sapphire manufacturing operations
for the benefit of Apple is not sustainable,” the company said
in court papers. “The relief requested in the wind-down motion
is necessitated by GTAT’s liquidity crisis and the substantial
daily cash burn of in excess of $1 million with respect to such
operations.” </p>
<p>GT Advanced in November announced a multiyear agreement to
supply Apple with sapphire. It lined up $578 million in
prepayment loans from Apple to pay for equipment to make the
material, which wasn’t included in the latest version of the
iPhone. The final payment of about $139 million was expected
this month. </p>
<h2>‘Preserving Jobs’ </h2>
<p>Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, today referred questions to its previous statement
on GT Advanced’s bankruptcy filing: </p>
<p>“We are focused on preserving jobs in Arizona following
GT’s surprising decision and we will continue to work with state
and local officials as we consider our next steps.” </p>
<p>GT Advanced dropped 40 percent to about 78 cents at 2:27
p.m. today in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/" density="sparse">New York</a> trading. The <a href="/quote/GTAT:US" class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" density="full">shares</a> traded above $11
before the Oct. 6 bankruptcy filing. </p>
<p>“While we continue to explore all options with regards to
our Mesa and Salem facilities, we recognize and regret the
impact that the actions outlined in our bankruptcy court filings
of this morning may have on valued GT employees,” Jeff Nestel-Patt, a GT Advanced spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>GT Advanced is also seeking permission to compensate 13
employees with incentive bonuses totaling as much as $64,700 for
their help closing down the Mesa and Salem plants. </p>
<h2>Sealed Documents </h2>
<p>The company yesterday requested to file certain documents
under seal to avoid violations of confidentiality agreements
that it said could have cost it millions of dollars in damages. </p>
<p>“We are not in a position to comment further on the
circumstances surrounding our Chapter 11 filing for the reasons
outlined at the bankruptcy court hearing Thursday, and which
were widely reported in the press,” Nestel-Patt said. </p>
<p>GT Advanced said confidentiality agreements broadly
preclude it from disclosing information concerning its business
relationship with Apple “except to the extent required by
law,” according to court papers. </p>
<p>An Oct. 15 hearing has been scheduled in Springfield,
Massachusetts, on the wind-down motion. </p>
<p>The case is In re GT Advanced Technologies Inc., 14-11916,
